    <h3>Some fun car facts </h3>
    <p>From the moment that rumors surfaced that the engine in the next C8-generation Corvette might move behind the seats, the presumption that the car would be a breakthrough, a revelation, and a revolution has followed it like a moon shadow. 
    Now it's here. And it does look more like a Ferrari than a Corvette, with the same cabin-forward proportions as every hyperfast, megadollar exotic on the market. And we've driven it extensively. So, has Chevrolet built a supercar for the masses—an American Ferrari—or simply a better Corvette? The answer is yes—but with an asterisk. It's complicated.</p>
    <p>We did our judging by spending a week in a C8 equipped with the $5000 track-capable Z51 Performance package and optional FE4 magnetorheological dampers (an additional $1895), the hottest version available at launch. We drove it on the road. We track-tested it to scrutinize its performance capabilities. 
    And we timed laps at Grattan Raceway outside of Grand Rapids, Michigan, in both the C8 and a similarly equipped C7-gen Z51 Vette to see whether the mid-engine model's claimed handling advantage over its front-engine predecessor is real.</p>
